parameters:
- param_name: Source Data
  df_param_type: table
  display_name: Source Data
  description: Select the source data table from the dropdown. This table contains
    the raw data on which you want to run segmentation. This could be sales data,
    survey data, feedback data collected from customers. It could also be demographic,
    psycho-graphic, firmographic or behavioral data of the customers.
  user_input_required: true
- param_name: Descriptor Data
  df_param_type: table
  display_name: Descriptor Data
  description: Select the data table that has the demographic, psycho-graphic, firmographic
    or behavioral data that describes the customers and is not being used as a part
    of source data. This data is used to validate the segments created using the source
    data.
  user_input_required: true
- param_name: Sample Data
  df_param_type: table
  display_name: Sample Data For Prediction
  description: Select the data table that has the new user/customer details to predict
    the segment they are most likely to associate with.

description: This app provides you with Market segmentation analysis along with a
  likelihood estimate of new customers falling into a particular segment. It uses
  standard segmentation practices (algorithms) to divide customers into smaller groups
  based on their specific characteristics like transaction history, behavior, age,
  income, and personality.The app also takes the data of the new users as input and
  predicts the particular segment they are most likely to associate with.
